Description syntax through XML, validation through XSD Schema\r\n\r\nParse text file to the syntax tree.\r\n\r\nContains the following levels of language representation:\r\n\r\n1. Symbol level\r\n\r\n\tTransform the text file into a sequence of characters\r\n\r\n2. Lexical level\r\n\r\n\tTransforms sequence of characters into tokens and lexemes - recognized words of existing grammar categories\r\n\r\n3. Syntax level\r\n\r\n\tChecks set of lexemes for compliance with existing rules and creates a syntax tree of recognized rules, \r\n\tstructures and tokens\r\n  \r\nTerms and rules are defined in the XML file lang.xml with a special syntax. The XSD schema file langSchema.xsd allows to check for correctness grammar file\r\n\r\n**Proof of concept, requires massive refactoring**\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zerobias/gosyn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zerobias/gosyn)\r\n\r\nAuto generated Godoc documentation is available here: [godoc.org/github.com/zerobias/gosyn](https://godoc.org/github.com/zerobias/gosyn)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
